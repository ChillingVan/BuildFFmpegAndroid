## Announcements
* This project script is generic, but you may modify some of the paths defined in the script or keep my directory structure, otherwise it will be unsuccessful when executing <br>
* If you download from the official website, then you need to follow my blog or other online tutorials on **FFmpeg** and **libfdk-aac** to make the changes, or there may exit some problem

## FAQ
1. 'aclocal-1.15' is missing on your system.  
Make sure:
	autotools-dev
	automake
	autoconf2.13
	m4
	
are installed
(I am not sure whether these are enough, if not, install 
	perl
	libperl5.14
	, too.
)
autoreconf -ivf
